Increases GLP-1 for Appetite & Glucose Control </strong></p><p>Nordburn GLP-1 Booster helps naturally stimulate <strong>GLP-1</strong>, a key metabolic hormone that reduces appetite, slows gastric emptying, and improves insulin sensitivity—helping you feel fuller longer while maintaining stable blood sugar levels. This effect is supported by Cissus <strong>Quadrangularis (CQR-300®), </strong>which has been clinically shown to <strong>increase GLP-1 levels by up to 56%</strong> in overweight individuals.</p><p><strong>2. Inhibits DPP-4 to Prolong GLP-1 Activity </strong></p><p>GLP-1 is rapidly broken down in the body, but <strong>CQR-300®</strong> also works to<strong> inhibit DPP-4</strong>, the enzyme responsible for degrading GLP-1. By slowing this breakdown, Nordburn GLP-1 Booster helps maintain elevated GLP-1 levels for longer-lasting appetite control and improved metabolic response.</p><p><strong>3. Enhances Gut Barrier & Microbiome Health</strong></p><p><strong>Akkermansia muciniphila,</strong> a next-generation probiotic included in Nordburn GLP-1 Booster, is well-established for its role in <strong>strengthening the gut lining and enhancing metabolic health</strong>. Recent research also indicates a<strong> strong link between Akkermansia abundance and increased GLP-1 secretion,</strong> suggesting it plays an active role in gut-mediated appetite and glucose regulation.</p><p><strong>4. Improves Blood Sugar Stability</strong></p><p><strong>Chromium Picolinate</strong> improves insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism, helping to <strong>reduce post-meal blood sugar spikes and support fat burning</strong>. Stable glucose levels reduce energy crashes, support hormonal balance, and make it easier to maintain a calorie deficit without intense cravings.</p>",

Increases GLP-1 for Appetite & Glucose Control</strong><br/><br/>Nordburn GLP-1 Booster helps naturally stimulate <strong>GLP-1,</strong> a key metabolic hormone that reduces appetite, slows gastric emptying, and improves insulin sensitivity—helping you feel fuller longer while maintaining stable blood sugar levels. This effect is supported by <strong>Cissus Quadrangularis (CQR-300®)</strong>, which has been clinically shown to increase <strong>GLP-1 levels by up to 56% in overweight </strong>individuals.<br/><br/><strong>2. Inhibits DPP-4 to Prolong GLP-1 Activity<br/><br/></strong>GLP-1 is rapidly broken down in the body, but <strong>CQR-300®</strong> also works to <strong>inhibit DPP-4</strong>, the enzyme responsible for degrading GLP-1. By slowing this breakdown, Nordburn GLP-1 Booster helps maintain elevated GLP-1 levels for longer-lasting appetite control and improved metabolic response.<br/><br/><strong>3. Enhances Gut Barrier & Microbiome Health<br/></strong><br/><strong>Akkermansia muciniphila</strong>, a next-generation probiotic included in Nordburn GLP-1 Booster, is well-established for its role in <strong>strengthening the gut lining and enhancing metabolic health</strong>. Recent research also indicates a <strong>strong link between Akkermansia abundance and increased GLP-1 secretion, </strong>suggesting it plays an active role in gut-mediated appetite and glucose regulation.<br/><br/><strong>4. Improves Blood Sugar Stability</strong><br/><br/><strong>Chromium Picolinate</strong> improves insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism, helping to <strong>reduce post-meal blood sugar spikes and support fat burning</strong>. Stable glucose levels reduce energy crashes, support hormonal balance, and make it easier to maintain a calorie deficit without intense cravings.</p>",
